## Session bootstrap (read first)

You are the **implementer agent** taking the next task in this
project. The orchestrator session in Zed has prepared everything you
need below; your job is to ship the "Immediate task" further down
this doc.

### Pre-flight (run before writing any code)

```bash
cd <repo-root>
git fetch && git checkout main && git pull --ff-only origin main
git log --oneline -5            # confirm main HEAD matches "Current state"
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest tests/ -q                # confirm baseline matches "Current state"
git status --porcelain exports/ # standing isolation gate — must be empty
git checkout -b <branch-name-from-Immediate-task>
```

The "Immediate task" section names the branch to create. If pytest
baseline or `git status exports/` doesn't match what's recorded under
"Current state", **stop and flag it** — the tracker is out of sync
with the repo and the orchestrator needs to hear about it before you
proceed.

### CI-mirror local check (before opening / re-pushing a PR)

The developer's `postdoc.db` (real user DB, ~50 KB at project root)
is a fall-through target for any test that uses
`database.get_*` without monkeypatching `database.DB_PATH`. CI
runners have no `postdoc.db`, so a missing-DB-init regression
surfaces ONLY on CI — locally it passes silently against your real
data.

Run the suite with `postdoc.db` moved aside before pushing the PR:

```bash
mv postdoc.db postdoc.db.bak
pytest tests/ -q
mv postdoc.db.bak postdoc.db
```

If pytest fails in this CI-mirror env but passes in your normal
local env, you have a fixture gap — a test is reading the real DB
unintentionally. Fix it by adding the conftest `db` fixture parameter
(or `db_and_exports` for export-content tests) so the suite is
self-contained. **Do not push a PR that passes locally but fails
this CI-mirror check** — main will go red, the orchestrator catches
it on PR review, and the fix lands as an urgent commit on top of an
in-flight tier.

This rule was added 2026-05-04 after PRs #32–#34 hit the same gap
on three smoke tests in `tests/test_exports.py` — the orchestrator's
post-mortem is in `ORCHESTRATOR_HANDOFF.md` "CI must be green before
admin-bypass".

### First action

Pre-announce in one sentence what you are about to do, then read in
order: `AGENTS.md` "Immediate task" block · `DESIGN.md` sections
cited there · the existing implementations the spec tells you to
mirror · the relevant existing tests. Only after that do you write
any code.

### Standing user preferences (apply throughout session)

- **Pre-announce non-trivial actions** in one sentence before doing
  them — not a plan document, just a sentence.
- **Didactic over terse.** When explaining a decision (architecture
  choice, why a test fails, what a Streamlit gotcha is), give the
  *reasoning*, not just the conclusion. The user is using this
  project to learn software engineering.
- **Show recommendations as something the user can redirect**, not a
  decided plan. The user reserves merge / strategy decisions.
- **Standing instruction formula.** When the user asks for a workflow
  they want repeatedly, codify it (the orchestrator updates this doc
  to capture it durably).

### Stop boundary

Stop after the PR opens. Do **not**:
- Touch `TASKS.md` / `CHANGELOG.md` / `reviews/` / `AGENTS.md`
  "Current state" + "Immediate task" sections — orchestrator-only.
- Push directly to `main` — PRs only.
- Skip the pre-commit checklist or the standing isolation gate.

After `gh pr create`, post the PR URL back and stop. The orchestrator
reviews, merges via admin bypass, and ships the `chore:` rollup
commit on main.

### PR conventions

- **PR title format:** `<type>(<scope>): <short description ≤72 chars>`
  — e.g. `chore(phase-6-T6): close-out + v0.7.0 tag prep` (T6 is doc-only, orchestrator-owned).
- **PR body:** `## Summary` bullets per deliverable + `## Test plan`
  checklist (mirror of recent merged PRs: #32, #33).
- If you made a non-obvious design call (cell shape, sort key,
  divergence from spec), flag it under Summary so the orchestrator
  can sanity-check before merge.

## What this project is

A local, single-user Streamlit web app that answers one daily question for
a postdoc job applicant: **"What do I do today?"** It tracks positions,
applications, interviews, and recommendation letters across institutions
with automated deadline alerts and markdown exports as portable backups.

**Stack:** Python 3.14 · Streamlit 1.57 · SQLite (`postdoc.db`) ·
pandas · Plotly · pytest · ruff

**Run it:** `source .venv/bin/activate && streamlit run app.py`
**Test it:** `pytest tests/ -q`
**Lint it:** `ruff check .`

## Repository layout (files you'll actually touch)

```
config.py              Constants only — statuses, thresholds, vocabularies

```

**Never touch:** `postdoc.db` · `exports/` · `CHANGELOG.md` ·
`TASKS.md` · `reviews/` · `CLAUDE.md`
(those are orchestrator-only; see "Coordination" below)

---

## Architecture rules (non-negotiable)

```
config.py   ← imports nothing from this project
database.py ← imports config only; NEVER imports streamlit
exports.py  ← imports database, config; NEVER imports streamlit
pages/*.py  ← imports database, config; NEVER imports exports
```

- **No raw SQL in page files.** All reads/writes go through `database.py`.
- **No `st.*` in `database.py`.** The DB layer must stay framework-agnostic.
- **Every `database.py` write function** must end with `exports.write_all()`
  called via deferred import (see existing write functions for the pattern).
- **Widget keys** use page-scoped prefixes:
  `qa_` (quick-add) · `edit_` (edit panel) · `apps_` (Applications page) ·
  `recs_` (Recommenders page) · `filter_` (filter bars) · `export_` (Export page)
- **Form ids** end with `_form`. Forms never contain `st.button` — use
  `st.form_submit_button` inside and `st.button` outside.
- **NaN coercion:** use `_safe_str(v)` before feeding DB values into widgets.
  Never use `r[col] or ""` — NaN is truthy.
- **Confirmations:** `st.toast`, not `st.success`.
  **Irreversible actions:** `@st.dialog` confirm gate.
- **Errors in save/delete handlers:** `st.error(str(e))`, never re-raise.
- **Type hints on all public functions.** Annotate `iterrows()` cells as `Any`.

## Current state (updated after each merged PR)

**Latest tag:** `v0.6.0` (Phase 5 complete — Applications + Recommenders pages)
**`main` HEAD:** Phase 6 T5 merged (PR #36); test suite at 834 passed + 1 xfailed

### Phase 5 — Applications + Recommenders pages ✅ closed at `v0.6.0`

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| T1 — Applications page shell + table | ✅ PR #15 | |
| T2 — Application detail card + cascade toast | ✅ PR #16 | |
| T3 — Inline interview list UI | ✅ PR #19 | |
| T4 — Recommenders page shell + Pending Alerts panel | ✅ PR #28 | `pages/3_Recommenders.py` created |
| T5 — Recommenders table + add form + inline edit | ✅ PR #29 | All-Recommenders + filters + Add form + inline edit + dialog Delete |
| T6 — Reminder helpers (mailto + LLM prompts) | ✅ PR #31 | Compose mailto link button + LLM prompts (2 tones) expander per Pending Alerts card |
| T7 — Phase 5 close-out + tag `v0.6.0` | ✅ | Cohesion-smoke at [`reviews/phase-5-finish-cohesion-smoke.md`](reviews/phase-5-finish-cohesion-smoke.md); CHANGELOG `[v0.6.0]` split |

### Phase 6 — Exports (markdown generators)

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| T1 — `write_opportunities()` generator | ✅ PR #32 | `exports/OPPORTUNITIES.md` — 8-column contract pinned by `TestWriteOpportunities`; raw bracketed status sentinels; idempotent |
| T2 — `write_progress()` generator | ✅ PR #33 | `exports/PROGRESS.md` — positions × applications × interviews; `_format_confirmation` + `_format_interviews_summary` tri-state helpers; conftest fixture lift (mandatory ride-along) closed T1 pollution |
| T3 — `write_recommenders()` generator | ✅ PR #34 | `exports/RECOMMENDERS.md` — 8-column contract; new local `_format_confirmed` (`—`/`No`/`Yes`); Reminder cell reuses `_format_confirmation`; `notes` deliberately omitted; smoke-test `fix:` commit augmented `isolated_exports_dir` to also monkeypatch DB_PATH (closed CI-red regression that had been latent since T1) |
| T4 — Export page (manual regenerate button + file mtimes) | ✅ PR #35 | `pages/4_Export.py` shell + regenerate button (try/except `write_all`, success toast, friendly `st.error`) + per-file mtimes panel (`st.markdown` lines, `Path.exists()` check + `os.utime`-deterministic test) |
| T5 — Export page (`st.download_button` per file) | ✅ PR #36 | three `st.download_button` widgets (one per locked filename) + `st.divider()` + `st.subheader("Download")` section header; `disabled=True` + `data=b""` when file absent, `data=Path.read_bytes()` when present; stacked layout above existing T4 mtime line |
| T6 — Phase 6 close-out + tag `v0.7.0` | 🔲 next | see "Immediate task" — orchestrator-owned (no implementer work) |

### What's after Phase 6
Phase 7 (Polish), v1.0-rc schema cleanup, then publish scaffolding
(README, LICENSE, Streamlit Cloud deploy). Full list in `TASKS.md`
§"Up next".

## Immediate task — Phase 6 T6 (close-out + tag `v0.7.0`) — **orchestrator-owned, no implementer work**

**Spec:** `TASKS.md` current sprint Phase 6 T6 · `GUIDELINES §11`
(version scheme — each minor bump marks one completed phase) ·
prior precedent `reviews/phase-5-finish-cohesion-smoke.md` (Phase 5
T7 close-out shape, written 2026-05-04 by orchestrator).

T6 closes Phase 6. **No implementer work** — same shape as Phase 5
T7. If you're an implementer agent and you've reached this block:
stop, ping the orchestrator, do not branch. The orchestrator will
ship T6 directly on main per the post-merge ritual.

### T6 deliverables (orchestrator-owned)

1. **Phase 6 cohesion-smoke + close-out doc**
   (`reviews/phase-6-finish-cohesion-smoke.md`) — mirror of
   `reviews/phase-5-finish-cohesion-smoke.md`. AppTest probes (Export
   page populated + empty + click-regenerate + post-regenerate); six
   cohesion dimensions audited (status labels, empty-state copy,
   date format, toast/error wording, NaN coercion, widget-key
   prefixes); tier-review carry-over triage across
   `phase-6-tier1-review.md` … `phase-6-tier5-review.md`.

   Carry-overs to triage:
   - **No carry-overs from T1, T2, T3.** Each tier-review doc's
     "Carry-overs" section either resolved its findings inline or
     noted them as kept-by-design (e.g. T2 N+1 interviews lookup,
     T3 `notes` column omission).
   - **T4** flagged `st.markdown` vs `st.write` cohesion as a Phase
     7 polish candidate (Finding #3). Track only.
   - **T5** flagged the wireframe-deviation stacked layout as
     kept-by-design (Finding #1). No follow-up needed.
   - **C2** (TRACKER_PROFILE) + **C3** ("All" filter sentinel +
     `_REMINDER_TONES`) still open from prior phases. Defer per
     the Phase 5 T7 disposition.
   - **Privacy amendment** (`exports/` `.gitignore`d, DESIGN §7
     contract #2 amended) landed in `43b3f3c` 2026-05-04 — note in
     the close-out as a structural change between v0.6.0 and v0.7.0.

2. **CHANGELOG.md split** — `[Unreleased]` → `[v0.7.0]` at the
   boundary commit (the T6 close-out commit itself), mirroring the
   Phase 5 v0.6.0 split precedent (commit `6f936d7`). Empty
   `[Unreleased]` accumulates Phase 7 work.

3. **Tag** — `git tag -a v0.7.0 -m "Phase 6 — Exports (markdown
   generators + Export page)"` with annotation listing the headline
   T1-T6 deliverables. Push.

4. **TASKS.md / AGENTS.md final flip** — T6 ✅; main HEAD line
   bumped; Immediate-task replaced with **Phase 7 T1** (Urgency
   colors on positions table per `TASKS.md` "Up next" → Phase 7).

5. **Recently-done entry** — one bullet for the v0.7.0 tag close-out.

### Pre-tag gates (GUIDELINES §11 + standing isolation + CI-mirror)
All six gates green at HEAD before tagging:
```bash
ruff check .
pytest tests/ -q
pytest -W error::DeprecationWarning tests/ -q
grep -rn '\[SAVED\]\|\[APPLIED\]\|\[INTERVIEW\]' app.py pages/ \
  | grep -v '^\([^:]*\):[0-9]*:\s*#'
git status --porcelain exports/
mv postdoc.db postdoc.db.bak && pytest tests/ -q && mv postdoc.db.bak postdoc.db
```

---

## TDD cadence (mandatory — GUIDELINES §11)

```
1. (T6 is doc-only, orchestrator-owned — no implementer test:/feat:
   commits. Implementer agents who reach this block should stop and
   ping the orchestrator. The next implementer task is Phase 7 T1.)
3. chore: commit → orchestrator handles TASKS.md/CHANGELOG/review doc
                   (YOU do not touch these)
```

**Commit message format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <short description ≤72 chars>

<optional body>
```
Types: `feat` · `fix` · `test` · `chore` · `docs` · `refactor`

---

## Pre-commit checklist (run before opening PR)

```bash
ruff check .                                    # must be clean
pytest tests/ -q                                # all pass (+ 1 xfail OK)
pytest -W error::DeprecationWarning tests/ -q   # same
# status-literal grep (must return 0 lines):
grep -rn '\[SAVED\]\|\[APPLIED\]\|\[INTERVIEW\]' app.py pages/ \
  | grep -v '^\([^:]*\):[0-9]*:\s*#'
# T2 isolation gate (standing — added 2026-05-04 with PR #33):
git status --porcelain exports/                 # must be empty post-pytest
```

## Coordination protocol

| Action | Who does it |
|--------|-------------|
| Write code, write tests | You (this agent) |
| Open PR | You — branch name: `feature/phase-7-tier1-UrgencyColors` (Phase 7 T1, after the orchestrator ships T6 close-out) |
| Review + merge PR | Orchestrator (Claude in Zed) |
| Update TASKS.md, CHANGELOG.md, reviews/ | Orchestrator only |
| Push directly to `main` | Nobody — PRs only |

**If you're unsure about a design decision:** check `DESIGN.md §7` (exports contract) first for Phase 6 work; see DESIGN §8 for the per-page UI contracts.
If it's not there, leave a comment in the code and note it in the PR
description — the orchestrator will resolve it before merging.
