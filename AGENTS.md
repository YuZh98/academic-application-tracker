## Session bootstrap (read first)

You are the **implementer agent** taking the next task in this
project. The orchestrator session in Zed has prepared everything you
need below; your job is to ship the "Immediate task" further down
this doc.

### Pre-flight (run before writing any code)

```bash
cd <repo-root>
git fetch && git checkout main && git pull --ff-only origin main
git log --oneline -5            # confirm main HEAD matches "Current state"
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest tests/ -q                # confirm baseline matches "Current state"
git status --porcelain exports/ # standing isolation gate — must be empty
git checkout -b <branch-name-from-Immediate-task>
```

The "Immediate task" section names the branch to create. If pytest
baseline or `git status exports/` doesn't match what's recorded under
"Current state", **stop and flag it** — the tracker is out of sync
with the repo and the orchestrator needs to hear about it before you
proceed.

### CI-mirror local check (before opening / re-pushing a PR)

The developer's `postdoc.db` (real user DB, ~50 KB at project root)
is a fall-through target for any test that uses
`database.get_*` without monkeypatching `database.DB_PATH`. CI
runners have no `postdoc.db`, so a missing-DB-init regression
surfaces ONLY on CI — locally it passes silently against your real
data.

Run the suite with `postdoc.db` moved aside before pushing the PR:

```bash
mv postdoc.db postdoc.db.bak
pytest tests/ -q
mv postdoc.db.bak postdoc.db
```

If pytest fails in this CI-mirror env but passes in your normal
local env, you have a fixture gap — a test is reading the real DB
unintentionally. Fix it by adding the conftest `db` fixture parameter
(or `db_and_exports` for export-content tests) so the suite is
self-contained. **Do not push a PR that passes locally but fails
this CI-mirror check** — main will go red, the orchestrator catches
it on PR review, and the fix lands as an urgent commit on top of an
in-flight tier.

This rule was added 2026-05-04 after PRs #32–#34 hit the same gap
on three smoke tests in `tests/test_exports.py` — the orchestrator's
post-mortem is in `ORCHESTRATOR_HANDOFF.md` "CI must be green before
admin-bypass".

### First action

Pre-announce in one sentence what you are about to do, then read in
order: `AGENTS.md` "Immediate task" block · `DESIGN.md` sections
cited there · the existing implementations the spec tells you to
mirror · the relevant existing tests. Only after that do you write
any code.

### Standing user preferences (apply throughout session)

- **Pre-announce non-trivial actions** in one sentence before doing
  them — not a plan document, just a sentence.
- **Didactic over terse.** When explaining a decision (architecture
  choice, why a test fails, what a Streamlit gotcha is), give the
  *reasoning*, not just the conclusion. The user is using this
  project to learn software engineering.
- **Show recommendations as something the user can redirect**, not a
  decided plan. The user reserves merge / strategy decisions.
- **Standing instruction formula.** When the user asks for a workflow
  they want repeatedly, codify it (the orchestrator updates this doc
  to capture it durably).

### Stop boundary

Stop after the PR opens. Do **not**:
- Touch `TASKS.md` / `CHANGELOG.md` / `reviews/` / `AGENTS.md`
  "Current state" + "Immediate task" sections — orchestrator-only.
- Push directly to `main` — PRs only.
- Skip the pre-commit checklist or the standing isolation gate.

After `gh pr create`, post the PR URL back and stop. The orchestrator
reviews, merges via admin bypass, and ships the `chore:` rollup
commit on main.

### PR conventions

- **PR title format:** `<type>(<scope>): <short description ≤72 chars>`
  — e.g. `test(phase-7-T4): confirm-dialog audit across destructive paths`.
- **PR body:** `## Summary` bullets per deliverable + `## Test plan`
  checklist (mirror of recent merged PRs: #32, #33).
- If you made a non-obvious design call (cell shape, sort key,
  divergence from spec), flag it under Summary so the orchestrator
  can sanity-check before merge.

## What this project is

A local, single-user Streamlit web app that answers one daily question for
a postdoc job applicant: **"What do I do today?"** It tracks positions,
applications, interviews, and recommendation letters across institutions
with automated deadline alerts and markdown exports as portable backups.

**Stack:** Python 3.14 · Streamlit 1.57 · SQLite (`postdoc.db`) ·
pandas · Plotly · pytest · ruff

**Run it:** `source .venv/bin/activate && streamlit run app.py`
**Test it:** `pytest tests/ -q`
**Lint it:** `ruff check .`

**Never touch:** `postdoc.db` · `exports/` · `CHANGELOG.md` ·
`TASKS.md` · `reviews/` · `CLAUDE.md`
(those are orchestrator-only; see "Coordination" below)

## Architecture rules (non-negotiable)

```
config.py   ← imports nothing from this project
database.py ← imports config only; NEVER imports streamlit
exports.py  ← imports database, config; NEVER imports streamlit
pages/*.py  ← imports database, config; NEVER imports exports
```

- **No raw SQL in page files.** All reads/writes go through `database.py`.
- **No `st.*` in `database.py`.** The DB layer must stay framework-agnostic.
- **Every `database.py` write function** must end with `exports.write_all()`
  called via deferred import (see existing write functions for the pattern).
- **Widget keys** use page-scoped prefixes:
  `qa_` (quick-add) · `edit_` (edit panel) · `apps_` (Applications page) ·
  `recs_` (Recommenders page) · `filter_` (filter bars) · `export_` (Export page)
- **Form ids** end with `_form`. Forms never contain `st.button` — use
  `st.form_submit_button` inside and `st.button` outside.
- **NaN coercion:** use `_safe_str(v)` before feeding DB values into widgets.
  Never use `r[col] or ""` — NaN is truthy.
- **Confirmations:** `st.toast`, not `st.success`.
  **Irreversible actions:** `@st.dialog` confirm gate.
- **Errors in save/delete handlers:** `st.error(str(e))`, never re-raise.
- **Type hints on all public functions.** Annotate `iterrows()` cells as `Any`.

## Immediate task — Phase 7 T4 (Confirm-dialog audit)

**Spec:** `TASKS.md` current sprint Phase 7 T4
("Confirm-dialog audit (every destructive path wears `@st.dialog`
with cascade-effect copy)") · `GUIDELINES §8` (irreversible actions:
`@st.dialog` confirm gate) · `docs/dev-notes/streamlit-state-gotchas.md`
gotcha #3 (dialog re-open trick — page must explicitly re-open
while pending sentinel is set) · existing `@st.dialog` call sites
in `pages/1_Opportunities.py`, `pages/2_Applications.py`,
`pages/3_Recommenders.py`.

Phase 7 T4 is a verification + harmonization sweep across every
**destructive path** in the app — verify every delete / cascade-
removal / irreversible action wears an `@st.dialog` confirm gate,
that the dialog-body copy includes cascade-effect language (what
will be lost), and that the gotcha #3 re-open trick is correctly
implemented at every call site. Pure cohesion work; no new behaviour.

### T4 — Confirm-dialog audit

- **Inventory every destructive path** in the app:
  - **Position delete** — `pages/1_Opportunities.py` line 55
    `@st.dialog("Delete this position?")` on
    `_confirm_delete_dialog`. Cascade: drops applications +
    interviews + recommenders for the position.
  - **Interview delete** — `pages/2_Applications.py` line 165
    `@st.dialog("Delete this interview?")` on
    `_confirm_interview_delete_dialog`. Cascade: drops the row
    only (no nested data).
  - **Recommender delete** — `pages/3_Recommenders.py` line 551
    `@st.dialog("Delete this recommender?")` on
    `_confirm_delete_recommender_dialog`. Cascade: drops the row
    only.
  - Verify these three are the ONLY destructive paths. Grep for
    `database.delete_*` and confirm every call site sits inside
    a dialog confirm branch (not a bare button click).
- **For each dialog audit four invariants:**
  1. **Title locked-shape**: `@st.dialog("Delete this <noun>?")`
     pattern.
  2. **Cascade-effect copy in body**: warning text must spell out
     what gets deleted (the row + any cascading data).
     Position-delete must mention applications + interviews +
     recommenders. Interview-delete + recommender-delete should
     mention "this cannot be undone" at minimum (they have no
     cascade today).
  3. **Re-open trick (gotcha #3)**: page must explicitly re-open
     the dialog while the pending sentinel is set, mirroring:
     ```python
     if st.button("Delete", ...):
         st.session_state[pending_sentinel] = target_id
         _confirm_dialog()
     elif st.session_state.get(pending_sentinel) == target_id:
         _confirm_dialog()
     ```
     Verify each call site has both branches.
  4. **Failure-preserves-state on st.error**: per GUIDELINES §8,
     a failed delete (e.g. FK constraint violation) must surface
     `st.error(...)` AND keep the pending sentinel set so the
     dialog re-opens for retry on the next rerun. NOT pop the
     sentinel on failure.
- **Fix any divergence inline**. If all three already satisfy the
  contract, the tier ships as a verification-only PR with new
  tests and no production code touched (mirror of T3's no-op
  outcome path).

### Tests to write first (TDD red commit)
- Extend `tests/test_pages_cohesion.py` (created in T3) with a
  new `TestConfirmDialogAudit` class — same parametrize-driven
  shape as `TestSetPageConfigSweep`. Source-grep + AST + AppTest
  hybrid:
  - **Source-grep**: every destructive path's call site shows the
    `@st.dialog("...?")` decorator pattern.
  - **AppTest behavioural pin**: for each delete path, simulate
    the click → assert dialog body contains expected
    cascade-effect substrings. Mirror the existing per-page tests
    in `test_opportunities_page.py` /
    `test_applications_page.py` / `test_recommenders_page.py` —
    don't duplicate them, but cite them as the per-page contracts
    + add a cross-page pin in `test_pages_cohesion.py` that asserts
    "every page-level delete button opens a dialog before writing".
  - **`database.delete_*` callers grep**: AST-walk all `pages/*.py`
    + `app.py` looking for `database.delete_*` calls; assert each
    sits inside a function decorated with `@st.dialog` (or inside
    the dialog's confirm-button click handler).

### Architecture rules (non-negotiable)
- T4 is verification + tests; no new helpers in production code.
- Widget keys: no new widgets.

### Pre-PR gates
Standing checklist + CI-mirror check.

### Branch + cadence
- Branch name: `feature/phase-7-tier4-ConfirmDialogAudit`.
- One PR for the test + (optional) feat commits; orchestrator
  handles the chore rollup post-merge. T4 may be verification-
  only like T3, or may surface fixable cascade-copy gaps —
  implementer flags the outcome shape in the PR description.

## TDD cadence (mandatory — GUIDELINES §11)

```
1. test: commit  → extend tests/test_pages_cohesion.py with
                   TestConfirmDialogAudit pinning every destructive
                   path's `@st.dialog` shape, cascade-effect copy,
                   re-open trick (gotcha #3), and failure-preserves-
                   state on `st.error` (RED if any divergence; GREEN
                   if all three already conform)
2. feat: commit  → fix any divergence (e.g. tighten cascade-effect
                   copy, add missing re-open branch); OMIT if all
                   destructive paths pass on the test commit
                   (no-op verification PR — same pattern as T3)
3. chore: commit → orchestrator handles TASKS.md/CHANGELOG/review doc
                   (YOU do not touch these)
```

**Commit message format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <short description ≤72 chars>

<optional body>
```
Types: `feat` · `fix` · `test` · `chore` · `docs` · `refactor`

## Coordination protocol

| Action | Who does it |
|--------|-------------|
| Write code, write tests | You (this agent) |
| Open PR | You — branch name: `feature/phase-7-tier4-ConfirmDialogAudit` |
| Review + merge PR | Orchestrator (Claude in Zed) |
| Update TASKS.md, CHANGELOG.md, reviews/ | Orchestrator only |
| Push directly to `main` | Nobody — PRs only |

**If you're unsure about a design decision:** check `DESIGN.md §7` (exports contract) first for Phase 6 work; see DESIGN §8 for the per-page UI contracts.
If it's not there, leave a comment in the code and note it in the PR
description — the orchestrator will resolve it before merging.
